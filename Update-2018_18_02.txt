Firstly, When I installed win 10 on the laptop and computer, I lost plenty of files, due to my recklesness.
Long story short I had to rebuild the repository. The way of sending data between play mode is made
by sending partial information from the client to the server from numerous places, wherefore the server
sends the whole chunk with update to the client waiting to recieve the information. One of the big improvements,
which I do not remember if I had done it before, is that the information of the uniq cards is not randomly made 
by the other player, but recieves this information, right before starting his turn to understand the current
battle.
